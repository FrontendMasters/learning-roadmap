                    <h2>Defining the Front-end Developer Role</h2>

                    <p>
                        Fundamentally a front-end developer, historically sometimes referred to as a client-side developer, produces the code sent from a web
                        server to a client/front-end to establish a user interface. For example, when you load a webpage into a web browser, code is sent from a
                        web server to the device/client requesting the page. The code sent will produce the user interface one sees in the web browser. This
                        code is considered front-end code and is a mixture of the web technologies <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/">HTML</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An individual typically enters into the field of front-end development by first learning to
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web"> build a simple website using HTML and CSS</a>.
                        HTML or HyperText Markup Language is likened to the structural framing of a house, while CSS or Cascading Style Sheets can be considered
                        the finishing touches one sees once a home is complete.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Eventually, the house (i.e., a website) will need to become automated. In other words, it will need to become interactive and respond to
                        events orchestrated by the user or the device on which it runs (e.g., on click or on load do X). To accomplish this, front-end
                        developers
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics"
                            >learn the JavaScript programming language</a
                        >
                        and use this language and the Document Object Model (aka the DOM) to add dynamic and interactive aspects to HTML and CSS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a front-end developer progresses in their career, they will move from a simple understanding of web pages and websites to potentially
                        a robust grasp of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices">software development practices</a>
                        as it is done on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web">the web platform</a> using the JavaScript programming language.

                    <h2>Front-End Developers Develop For...</h2>

                    <p>
                        Front-end developers develop for the web platform, and the web platform is most commonly associated with web browser run times. Open a
                        web browser like Google Chrome, navigate to a web page like google.com, and what you are looking at was developed by a front-end
                        developer who developed the web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The web platform runtime is not just for web browsers. It can also be used by
                        <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/94181cd63583b60835d2db9869d9a194bab308ed.pdf">WebViews</a>
                        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications">Progressive Web App (aka PWA)</a> techniques to create
                        native-like applications that are installed on an operating system. This means that a front-end developer can take their knowledge of
                        web technologies and the web platform run time associated with browsers and web development and use these skills to create native
                        applications for popular operating systems like Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, and Linux.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Loosely, think of a WebView or PWA like a single tab from a web browser without an address bar or backward and forward buttons, that is
                        embedded into a native application. This scenario is identical to the browser, and WebViews/PWA's run from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but
                        instead of facilitating internet access to web pages the intention is the web platform runtime is used to access the native operating
                        systems APIs (i.e., A single browser view of a web page(s), using web technologies, that is run like a native application that may or
                        may not be connected to the internet that has access to native operations either via native web APIs or bridges from web technologies to
                        native APIs).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most common solutions for <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/" target="_blank">WebView</a> development
                        are:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js" target="_blank">NW.js</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://neutralino.js.org/" target="_blank">Neutralino.js</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://deskgap.com/" target="_blank">DeskGap</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Front-end developers can also find themselves developing source code using web platform technologies (e.g., CSS and JavaScript), but
                        then the source code created is not used by a web platform run time scenario but instead as input which gets translated to native run
                        time code. Basically, coding environments exist where web technologies are written not to run on the web platform but written to be used
                        as input to create real native applications using native APIs.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some examples of these environments are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        As you can see, Front-end developers not only develop for web browsers but also for several other run time scenarios beyond web
                        browsers. Being a front-end developer today could mean creating webpages and web applications that are accessed via web browsers, but it
                        can also mean creating native applications that are installed on operating systems and run offline (e.g.
                        <a href="https://electronjs.org/apps/visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code is built using Electron</a>).

                    <p>
                        As of late, defining the skills of a front-end developer has become complicated due to a significant divide in the front-end developer
                        profession. A <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">gap has arisen between those front-end developer</a>s who focus on
                        programming and becoming a traditional computer science-oriented JavaScript/software developer, and all this entails, and those who
                        focus more on the UI, HTML, CSS and happen to know some JavaScript. This gap, for better or worse, was orchestrated by the fact that
                        JavaScript infiltrated the back-end and thus back-end developers in time found themselves writing JavaScript back-ends with tools like
                        <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">mongoDB</a>. Eventually, these engineers infiltrated
                        the front-end. The good news is this scenario resulted in a front-end and JavaScript renaissance. Pretty much, everything got better.
                        Tools. Frameworks. Package Managers. Libraries. CSS. JavaScript. But, it especially got better for those who already had a command of
                        the JavaScript programming language. The bad news this renaissance also diluted and complicated the skills required to do front-end
                        development and has pulled the profession towards a more engineering-focused field of work often requiring traditional computer science
                        training and software development know-how over UI experience. Unfortunately, for the time being, getting a front-end developer job
                        today might come down to how much you know about computer science theory, software development, or the specifics parts of the ECMAScript
                        specification. I say unfortunately because, in my opinion, what is more important than these matters is a robust understanding of how to
                        construct a usable touch point between the user and the code.

                        Simultaneously, a trend has been occurring for several years now where websites and web applications are being built using a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_client">thick/fat client architecture</a> (e.g.,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Applications or SPA's</a>). Meaning, what was once mostly
                        done on the server is now done in the client at runtime. In short, the application logic that runs a website or web application will
                        today often run in the client instead of on the server. When this architecture is in use, the data that drives the website or web
                        application is requested at runtime by the client using a <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api-university">data API</a>
                        (i.e., an interface that returns data only, typically in the form of
                        <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>). What this means for the front-end developer profession is what was once consider back-end
                        competencies are now becoming required competencies to do front-end development (e.g.,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">Software Development</a>,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_development">Web Application Development</a>,

                    <p>
                        Due to the divide mentioned above and the movement towards thick/fat applications in the client, the front-end skillset spectrum is
                        currently being stretch by what is known as a full-stack developer. A full-stack developer can supposedly not only code a front-end
                        application UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for multiple screen sizes but can also develop the database and data API as well as the
                        web server serving the client. It is this author's opinion that this jack of all development trades has been seen before in the form of
                        a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmaster">webmaster</a> and
                        <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">back-end framework developers</a>. The author believes that history will repeat itself and the
                        notion of a single do it all developer will run its course again and then eventually be wisely replaced with reasonably focused
                        developers either working mainly on the front-end or back-end with a clear separation. I believe this will happen because the mile wide
                        and inch deep developer is ultimately inept at properly caring for the UI and user experience. Don't get me wrong, a one in a million,
                        unicorn, rock star developer does exist. But modeling a profession on such an individual is impractical.

                    <h2>Job Titles</h2>

                    <p>
                        As I just mentioned, a great
                        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">divide</a> has been brewing in the front-end developer space for several years
                        between two very different types of front-end developers. On the one side, you have JavaScript-focused programmers who write JavaScript
                        for front-end runtimes that likely have computer science skills with a software development history. They probably view HTML and CSS as
                        an abstraction (i.e., <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a> and
                        <a href="https://hackernoon.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-css-in-js-984a72d48ebc">CSS in JS</a>). On the other side, you have, most
                        likely, non-computer science educated developers who focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as it specifically pertains to the UI. When
                        entering or trying to understand the front-end developer space, you will feel this divide. The term front-end developer is on the verge
                        of meaninglessness without clarifying words to address what type of front-end developer is being discussed.

                        Below is a list and description of the most common front-end job titles (Keep in mind titles are
                        <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/dissecting-front-end-job-titles-7f72a0ef0bc5">hard</a>). The common, or most used (i.e., generic),
                        title for a front-end developer is "front-end developer" or "front-end engineer." Note that any job that contains the word "front-end",
                        "client-side", "web UI", "HTML", "CSS", or "JavaScript" typically infers that a person has some degree of HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript
                        professional know-how.

                    <h2>Overlapping Disciplines</h2>
                    <p>A front-end developer will often work on a web development team containing the following roles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project Lead / Product owner (i.e., stakeholder, project manager, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Visual Designer (i.e., fonts, colors, spacing, emotion, visual concepts &amp; themes)</li>
                        <li>UI/Interaction Designer (i.e., wireframes, specifying all user interactions and UI functionality, structuring information)</li>
                        <li>Front-End Developer (i.e., writes code that runs on the client or front-end)</li>
                        <li>Back-End Developer (i.e., writes code that runs on the server)</li>

                    <p>
                        The five roles just mentioned can overlap each other. For example, a front-end developer will typically have a good handle on
                        UI/Interaction design as well as Back-end development. Additionally, it is not uncommon to find a Visual Designer who does Interaction
                        Design and can also contribute to front-end coding efforts.

                            unrealistic expectations are being placed on front-end developers to operate at a professional level anywhere in the development
                            stack while also being proficient at user interface development.
