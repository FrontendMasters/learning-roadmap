          <p>
            It is the internet that makes the World Wide Web possible. The
            internet is a global system of connected devices, routers, and
            modems.

          <p>
            People will often think of the internet and the World Wide Web (aka
            WWW) interchangeable but the internet is specifically the layers of
            networking that exist to make the connection of devices possible.
            Most people are connected to the internet by paying an
            <a href="https://www.whoismyisp.org/"
              >Internet Service Provider (aka ISP)</a
            >
            for access in the form of a wired connection directly to a
            business/home or a wireless connection from a cellular tower or
            satellite.
          </p>

          <p>
            No one person, company, or organization or government runs the
            internet.

          <h2>TCP & IP</h2>

          <p>
            The Transmission Control Protocol (aka TCP) is roughly the baseline
            protocol that is used so that interconnected devices on the internet
            can communicate with each other. In other words the internet
            infrastructure connects devices to each other, but TCP is the
            baseline language/interface (i.e protocols) that allow devices
            (computers, laptops, phones etc..) to speak to each other in a
            common way (i.e. TCP defines how data travels on the internet).
          </p>
          <p>
            TCP specifically directs packets (i.e. chunked data) of information
            to a specific application on a specific device connected to the
            network that can be identified using a Internet Protocol Address
            (aka IP address).
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of an IP address like your home address. Your home address
            locates your home. IP's addresses locate a specific device in a
            network. An IP address is written as a numeric string of characters
            with periods and slashes (e.g. 192.168.100.14) using

          <h2>HTTP</h2>
          <p>
            The internet, TCP, and IP make it possible for one device to
            exchange data with another device on the network using basically
            ones and zeros (i.e. packets of data). On the world wide web when
            dealing with web pages a specific type of data exchange is taking
            place. Typically a web browser or client/user-agent is asking for
            data from a specific location/device serving a very specific type of
            data over the network (e.g. a computer running server software on
            the network/internet). This requires a specific protocol sitting on
            top of the baseline TCP/IP protocols. Basically, the WWW runs
            because a client like a web browser can connect to a web server
            through the internet, and this client can talk to a web server use
            the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (aka HTTP) to exchange data most
            commonly written in the Hyper Text Markup Language (aka HTML).

          <p>
            When a user enters a URL into a web browser/client (e.g.
            google.com), an HTTP request is sent over the internet to a web
            server typically asking the server to send back a specific an
            <code>.html</code> document/file containing HTML. What is returned
            is a document containing information written in the Hyper Text
            Markup Language that is then used by the web browser/client to
            visually display information to the user. It might be helpful to
            think of an HTML document as a very particular kind of text document
            that can contain text, images, user interface widget, and videos
            wrap/tagged with semantical meaning (i.e. HTML tags) to be displayed
            to the user.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hypertext Transfer Protocol (aka HTTP) is the webs foundational
            protocol that sits on top of TCP and IP. In terms of the World Wide
            Web, HTTP is the foundational mechanism that allows a user to
            request and send data over the internet (i.e. request .html, .jpg,
            .js, .css etc...).
          </p>

          <p>
            A professional front-end developer will have an in-depth
            understanding of HTTP.

          <p>
            Browsers use a Uniform Resource Locator (aka a URL) to locate unique
            resources over the internet on web servers (i.e. HTML files, CSS
            files, JavaScript files, image files, video files, font's files,
            etc..).
          </p>

          <p>
            A URL is broken down into the following parts (Protocol &gt; Domain
            Name &gt; Path (optional) &gt; Parameters/Query (optional) &gt;
            Fragment/Anchor (optional)):
          </p>

          <h4>Protocol</h4>

          <p>
            As you might expect the protocol of the World Wide Web is HTTP. So a
            URL will start with:
          </p>
          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://
                    </code></pre>

          <h4>Domain Name</h4>

          <p>
            The next part of a URL is a domain name. The domain name is made up
            of three sub parts separated by a period. The Top Level Domain,
            label 1, and label 2.
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://label2.label1.topleveldomain

e.g.

http://www.google.com or http://google.com (the label 2 or www is optional)

</code></pre>

          <p>
            Typically label 1 is a semantical cue as to the content found at the
            domain. The Top Level Domain portion is a fixed set of characters,
            the most common being <code>.com</code>, but nowadays more options
            are available (e.g. .biz, .org, .us etc...).
          </p>

          <p>
            Domains are purchased from a domain host and once you own a domain
            name you can subdivide the domain using label 2. Label 2 is often
            refereed to as a sub-domain.
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">     
http://email.google.com (goes to gmail not google homepage)
              </code></pre>

          <h4>Path (optional)</h4>

          <p>
            If a url has a valid protocol and domain, then it has located a
            specific web server. A path is used to request specific files from
            the web server. Roughly speaking a path is how you tell a web server
            to look in X folder and find file Y, and server that file to the web
            browser (typically that file is an .html document).
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://label2.label1.topleveldomain/folder1/folder2insideof1/folder3insideof2/file.type
            
e.g. 

http://mydomain.com/about/me.html

or

http://mydomain.com/about/index.html (But could just be http://mydomain.com/about/)
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            Note that paths or directories are indicated by using a single
            <code>/</code>. A server can be setup up to server default files
            from a directory/folder but a path can also end by requesting a
            specific file from a folder/directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            If no path is used then a default file (typically
            <code>index.html</code>) is returned from the root directory.
          </p>

          <h4>Parameters (optional, aka query)</h4>

          <p>
            The URL can be used to send data from the url to the web server. At
            any point after the path if you add <code>?</code> followed by
            <code>name=jill&lastname=doe</code> the data <code>name</code> and
            <code>lastname</code> and their values will be sent to the server as
            part of the request.
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://mydomain.com/about/?name=jill&lastname=doe
                        </code></pre>

          <h4>Fragment Identifier (optional, aka anchors)</h4>

          <p>
            An fragment identifier can be used to tell the client/browser to
            adjust the view so that something specific in the HTML document is
            within the view port of the browser. Some speak of fragment
            identifiers as way of bookmarking and directly linking to a specific
            part of a webpage. To add an anchor to a url use <code>#</code> at
            the end of a URL followed by a name.
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://mydomain.com/contact/?answer=yes#section1.2
                                      </code></pre>

          <p>
            Note that for the browser to adjust the view port to a specific part
            of the HTML document that HTML document has to have an element with
            an id attribute that matches the name provide in the URL (e.g.
            <code>&lt;div id=&quot;section1.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>).
          </p>

          <p>
            While its possible to make a home computer connected to the internet
            a web server and available on the internet, most people use a web
            hosting service to server webpages. Web hosts setup a web server for
            you (e.g. <a href="https://www.apache.org/">apache</a> or
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>) to use and the tools
            needed to connect a domain name to the web server. A popular web
            hosting service would be
            <a href="https://www.bluehost.com">bluehost</a> (Not uncommon for a
            web hosting service to offer domain hosting service as well)
          </p>

          <p>
            A web hosting service is not strictly require to serve web pages.
            One can run web server software on their own computer using a local
            IP address (typically 127.0.0.1) and connect to the server locally
            using the URL's http://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000.
            Front-end developers typically develop web pages/apps locally using
            to facilitate the client server relationship without having to pay
            for web hosting or a domain name.

          <p>
            Services are available, called Domain Registers that are simply used
            to purchase and host domain names. A popular domain host would be
            <a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> (It is not uncommon
            for a domain host to offer web hosting services as well).

          <p>
            Don't over think Domain Name Servers (aka NDS). They are essentially
            a service that returns an IP address for a domain name. Without
            domain name servers a url to google would look something like:
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://172.217.20.110 (actually works in a browser try it)

</code></pre>

          <p>instead of:</p>

          <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-http noRun">
http://google.com

</code></pre>

          <p>
            DNS servers make it so URL's are more human friendly/readable and
            can contain semantical meaning. Which means domains can be indexed
            and searched for in a meaningful way using keywords.
